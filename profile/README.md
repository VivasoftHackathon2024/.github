# FrameWise: AI Powered Video Analysis Platform

This project leverages advanced AI technologies to provide comprehensive analysis of video content, transforming vast amounts of unstructured video data into actionable insights. By integrating state-of-the-art Vision Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), our platform offers real-time monitoring, detailed summarizations, and interactive querying capabilities.

Key Features:

1. Automated Video Logging and Summarization: Efficiently processes and condenses extensive video footage into concise summaries for quick review.

2. Specialized Analytical Agents: Includes agents for detecting specific events such as fires, assaults, thefts, and other suspicious activities, enhancing security and operational efficiency.

3. Interactive Chat Interface: Allows users to engage with video logs through natural language queries, facilitating intuitive data retrieval and analysis.

4. Support for Streaming and Uploaded Videos: Capable of analyzing both live video streams and pre-recorded footage, providing flexibility across various use cases.

Use Cases:

1. Public Safety: Assists government agencies in monitoring and responding to criminal activities, thereby enhancing community safety.

2. Retail Analytics: Provides insights into customer behavior, supporting targeted marketing strategies and improving customer experiences.

3. Industrial Monitoring: Ensures compliance with safety protocols and detects anomalies in operational processes, reducing risks and improving efficiency.
